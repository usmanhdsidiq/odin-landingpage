        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            AKB48 (pronounced A.K.B. Forty-Eight) is a Japanese idol musical girl group named after the Akihabara area in Tokyo, where the group's theater is located. AKB48 has sold more records than any other female musical act in Japanese history.[2] AKB48's producer, Yasushi Akimoto, wanted to form a girl group with its own theater and performing daily so fans could always see them live (which is not the case with usual pop groups giving occasional concerts and seen on television).[3] This "idols you can meet" concept includes teams[4] which can rotate performances and perform simultaneously at several events[5] and "handshake" events, where fans can meet group members.[3] Akimoto has expanded the AKB48 concept to several girl groups within Japan, and internationally in Mainland China, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan, and Philippines.

        <h3>Discography</h3>
        <p>
            The discography of AKB48 consists of 63 singles (61 major singles and 2 indie singles), 6 studio albums, 3 compilation albums, and 32 stage albums (12 regular stage albums and 20 as Studio Recordings Collection). The major singles have title tracks that are sung by a selection of the AKB48 singers, some of whom are from AKB48's sister groups. Some of the singles are considered annual "election singles", that is, they contain ballots for a popularity contest to determine the line-up for the next single. Other singles have line-ups that are determined by rock-paper-scissors tournaments that are held annually. The group was created and currently produced by Yasushi Akimoto, who also writes the lyrics for all of the group's songs. They released 2 compilation albums before released their debut album titled Koko ni Ita Koto.[1][2]
